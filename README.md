## METU Computer Engineering Department
### CENG301 - Algorithms and Data Structures

This is all the course content, apart from examinations because they don't put
exams on the internet, including course slides and homeworks. Homeworks also
have my solutions to them.

I have three reasons for putting all of this on GitHub:
* I like to have my stuff under version control and I like it better if there are multiple copies on different places.
* Perhaps future students of the course will find some of the information useful.
* But most of all, I would like to show people that METU (my school) is not nearly as good as it is.

I would like to expand on the last point:
* Take a look at the slides, they are extremely unprofessional. Lots of typos, code excerpts that wouldn't work at all.
* Read the homework pdf files. We are forced to write our code the way it is stated on the pdf. Whoever prepares the homework assignments must be a world class idiot. We are not allowed to define functions that aren't stated in the pdf. 

Enough rant.

I hope someone will get some use out of this stuff.

The password to the pdf slides in the ``Course slides`` directory is ``METU-CENG``. Who would seriously encrypt this stupid stuff?! (I couldn't get the password off of them, sorry).
